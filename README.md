# NodeJS Typescript Template 
Bare template for nodejs + typescript

## What is already in here :rocket:
* eslint
* ts config
* jest config
* nodemon config
* file structure following with: router, controller, service, startup config
* simple jest unit test if you're new to it
* http requests for quick testing

## What is missing :construction_worker:
Well, a lot :smiley:, but I'll try to keep this up to date and include a few missing things
* proper error handling
* proper logging
* basic security
* hooks

## Notes
This is an attempt to help a few folks trying to get a grasp on nodejs(and ts) as well as for my own use :new_moon_with_face:
